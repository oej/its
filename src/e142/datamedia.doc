DATAMEDIA is a macro library that attempts to make EMACS more
accessible to the SRI user.  It does this in three ways:

	1.  The command set has been rearranged and regularized, making
it easier to learn and easier to remember.
	2.  The command set is optimized for the Datamedia keyboard.
Maximal use is made of the keypad at the right side.  Almost all
editing commands use the edit-key, some use the control-key as well;
there are very few commands that use the control-key alone.
	3.  Some new functions have been added, and others have been
modified, to provide additional capability.

If interest warrants, the EMACS documentation under the INFO subsys
could be rewritten to reflect the new functions.  But for the
present, users new to EMACS should follow the following procedure:
List yourself copies of <EMACS>DATAMEDIA.CHART (it's formatted for
wide paper) and <EMACS>DATAMEDIA.CONVERSION.  Start up EMACS, type ^_
(the "hold" key) followed by "I" to get yourself into the INFO
system, then follow directions.  Whenever the documentation talks
about a particular command, (for example C-F,) look in your listing
of DATAMEDIA.CONVERSION to find the new equivalent (M-> in this
example).  Locate the new command in DATAMEDIA.CHART so you can see
the relationship of this command to other commands.

Users already somewhat familiar with EMACS should find DATAMEDIA.CHART
self-explanatory.

To use the new command set, use the command MM Load$DATAMEDIA.  (Type
Edit-X, "LOAD", escape, "DATAMEDIA", carriage return.) To have new
new command set automatically load whenever you use EMACS, copy the
file <AGIN>EMACS.INIT or the equivalent to your own directory.

Note that the commands that move forward and back by words or delete
words always move to the beginnings of words.  The same commands with
a ^X prefix move to the ends of words.  In the original EMACS it
depended on which direction you approached from.

Ten "fixed marks" have been provided in addition to THE mark.  "The
region" is still defined by the pointer and THE mark; the additional
fixed marks provide the capability of designating some particular
spot in your file that stays put while you copy text elsewhere.  With
no arguments, the new command M-M sets THE mark and the command M-G
goes to THE mark (Exchange Point and Mark).  With a numeric argument
(0-9) they set or go to the corresponding fixed mark.

C-X and M-X provide the identical function in the new command set.
They are redundant for convenience in typing commands like C-X C-D
(Directory Display) or M-X M-D (Kill Word) without shifting bits in
mid-command. 

The functions for editing LISP code sometimes double up on
keystrokes.  For example, M-F will either be Forward Sentence or
Forward List depending on whether you are in LISP mode or some other
mode.  There are ties to the Interlisp/EMACS interface, which allows
you to call EMACS directly from Interlisp to edit LISP functions and
S-expressions.  The interface is documented in the file
<BOYER>NEMACS.DOC.

If you plan to make regular use of EMACS/Datamedia, send me a message
so I can keep you up to date on changes.
