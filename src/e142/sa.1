In the past, I have been involved in several different areas of both Chemistry and
Computer Science.  Ideally, I would like to find a topic for research (and,
eventually, a career) which encompasses aspects of both of those interests.

My interest in both chemistry and computer science goes back to high school, where my
chemistry instructor, Dr. George Biehl, sparked not only my initial interest in
chemistry, but also served as my instructor when I enrolled in a lunch-time
minicourse in computer programming.  The following year, as my interest increased, I
actually taught the course, with Dr. Biehl serving as my adviser.

For some time, I was undecided as to whether to specialize in chemistry or computer
science; my first technically oriented job was actually in computers: operator and,
later, systems programmer for the Stanford University Medical Experimental center for
Artificial Intelligence in Medicine (SUMEX-AIM).  I was primarily responsible for
improving and maintaining the file backup system and other systems and user-support
programming.  This job gave me considerable exposure to current research activities,
such as Lederberg's "Dendral" programs for structure enumeration and elucidation and
Wipke's "Strategic Evaluation off Chemical Synthesis (SECS)" program.

My second technical position, which I continue to hold, is that of a member of the
technical staff of the medical/analytical instrumentation division of Hewlett/Packard
laboratories.  In this diverse group of scientists and engineers, I have been
carrying out research towards the development of new instrumentation.  Specifically,
I have worked with another organic chemist and an optical engineer in a study of the
feasibility of using visible ATR spectroscopy and surface bound indicators in a
device for rapid blood pH determination.  My contribution to this project consisted
of the synthesis and characterization of several models for surface bound indicators,
such as N-substituted sulfonamides of phenolsulfonphthaleins.  More recently, I have
been working with a physical chemist studying the effect of oxygen on room
temperature phosphorescence, with the idea of using that effect to rapidly measure
atmospheric and/or dissolved (blood) oxygen.  I have been preparing dyes which show
phosphorescence while adsorbed to a surface such as silica gel or filter paper for
testing of their usefulness in such a device.

Finally, I am presently engaged in research with Dr. E. E. van Tamelen.  Here, I am
continuing work begun by one of his graduate students, developing a total synthesis
of the natural products Triptolide and Stemolide.

At the present time, I have not formulated a detailed plan of study and research.  If
ind synthetic organic chemistry very interesting and challenging, but I hope not to
restrict myself to that relatively narrow field.  I believe that computers are going
to become increasingly more useful to the chemist; particularly interesting are
Artificial Intelligence applications, such as Dr. Corey's work in computer aided
synthesis.  While computer controlled instrumentation is becoming increasingly
commonplace, very few of these systems are actually "smart" about the chemistry which
is being controlled.
