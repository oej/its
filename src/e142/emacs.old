05/23/79 14:55:24RUBENSTEINPAGE library screwing up INFOThe PAGE library shouldn't be screwing up INFO any more.  The problem
was a complex one, based on the fact that PAGE's visit file hook
didn't end with a ^\, so id didn't pop the q-register stack, which
was pushed by Visit File, so & Info Select Node's q-registers were
still on the stack when Visit File returned.  Anyway, it should
work fine now...

04/21/79 23:32:55RUBENSTEINEMACS 133EMACS 133 is now the default version of EMACS.  You can still get
EMACS 131 for a little while by running <SUBSYS>OEMACS

04/21/79 23:31:25RUBENSTEINFind File Inhibit WriteThis variable is used to determine whether you like ^X ^F, ^X ^V or
^X ^E as your default file-visiting command.  It is used by ^X ^F
to determine which method to use, and it is also used to determine
how to read in a file requested by the exec EDIT command.  If you like
^X ^E, do 0U$Find File Inhibit Write$ in your init file.  ^X ^V and
^X ^R are 1 and -1, respectively.

04/14/79 16:39:42RUBENSTEINEMACS version 133Changes in EMACS version 133:

*) The self documentation features now know about names for the
built-in TECO ^R command definitions.  For example, Apropos of "Line"
will now show ^R Open Line on C-O.  You can't actually call those
commands by those names, unless you load the library BARE;  this
library is temporarily loaded by the documentation commands that need
it.  MM& Load BARE loads BARE and causes BARE to remain loaded until
its caller returns.

*) C-U C-Y differs from plain C-Y in that it leaves point before
the un-killed text and the mark after.

*) C-U C-L causes the line point is on to be redisplayed.
Actual numeric arguments (not just C-U) still specify
a line to display point on.

*) C-; and M-; (^R Indent for Comment) now inserts the comment
terminator as well as the comment starter, leaving point in between
them.  M-N and M-P (^R Down Comment Line, and .. Up ..), have been
modified for this behavior.

*) M-G and M-Q (^R Fill Paragraph and ^R Fill Region) now by default
remove excess spaces such as are produced by filling.

*) Return now will not gobble a blank line followed by a nonblank
line.

*) C-K will now treat a blank line as if it were empty, killing
through the CRLF instead of to it.  More specifically, if point is
followed by a CRLF with only whitespace in between, C-K will kill
through the CRLF.

*) M-[ and M-] (^R Backward Paragraph, and ... Forward ...), now treat
"\" at the front of a line just like "." and "-", for the sake of TEX
files.  This special treatment is that if those characters are
declared (using QParagraph Delimiter) to start paragraphs, then
whenever a paragraph starts for that reason, that paragraph is only
one line long.

*) You can now put MM Query Replace on a character.  It will read its
arguments in the echo area.

*) Errors in auto-saving will type out "(Auto Save Error!)".

*) ^R Indent Nested (the definition of Tab in certain modes) now does
something useful with negative arguments.  It indents the line more
than the previous line, (* (ABS ARGUMENT) (MAX 1 QIndent Increment))
spaces more.  QIndent Increment is not initially defined.

*) There is now an autoloading definition for C-X ( which loads in
KBDMAC and transfers to it.  People need no longer load KBDMAC in
their init files.  You will now see "Def" in the mode line while
defining a keyboard macro.

*) Exiting from the top-level ^R invocation now returns to EMACS's
superior.  To exit from it back to TECO command level, do
1MM Top Level.  This will advise you to re-enter ^R mode by doing
:M..L.  Returning to the superior will now clear out the mode line
completely.

*) Creating a new buffer initializes it in the same mode as the
previous selected buffer.  This uses the new @F^G command in TECO.

*) Making variables like QAuto Fill Mode local now works
straightforwardly;  it is no longer necessary to deal with the crock
Switch Modes Process Options, which no longer exists.  These variables
have been equipped with macros which are run whenever their values
change.  Thus, simply doing 1UAuto Fill Mode is enough to turn on
the mode.  MM & Process Options no longer exists.  A side effect of
this is that buffer switching is much faster.  This uses the new
FS VAR MACRO feature of TECO.  QProcess Options Hook no longer
exists; instead, you must make macros to be run when your variables'
values change.  This will be documented in CONV later.

*) Instead of calling MM & Set Mode Line, macros should simply do
1FS Mode Change, which will cause MM & Set Mode Line to be called
when the mode line comes up for redisplay.  Thus, multiple reasons for
calling it will not cause it to be called more than once.
QSet Mode Line Hook still exists and works as before.

04/02/79 15:07:56USECSA request fo a new featureWould it be possible to have a command to fork a new EXEC from emacs?
	Michael Toy
03/30/79 11:58:37RUBENSTEINPDL overflows and other EMACS lossagesIf you get any of these, the best thing to do is save your core
image and then give the START command.  This will cause EMACS
to re-initialize itself, but your buffers will still remain
intact -- you won't lose any work.  Then send me a message
giving as many details as possible...

Stew
03/30/79 11:54:13RUBENSTEIN^E "bug"C-E is redefined (in ALL modes) to do ^R Exchange Characters.  This
used to be on C-T.  To get end of line, use C-M->.  If you want, a couple
of people have adopted the AI lab editor's convention of M-tab for
end of line and M-^L for beginning (or reversed, I don't remember.  I
personally like to have those two commands self inserting, as they are
in vanilla EMACS.

Stew
03/26/79 12:55:27USECSNews featureI vote to keep the news. It seems to be an effective way for
EMACS users to report bugs and also to find out about bugs that
others have caught. I don't really like the # hack, but it is
just a small irritation. I would rather have to invoke the news
manually instead of having the first character I type echo
incorrectly.

03/25/79 22:14:06SCHOENanother bug
Beware of pushdown overflow...I got one when trying to get INFO 
through the documentation package.

 Eric03/25/79 09:25:53SCHOEN^E bug
Watch out!  At least in MIDAS mode, ^E doesn't go to the end of the line,
but splits the carriage return-linefeed sequence separating the current 
line from the previous line around the first character of the current line,
like:
  
start:	reset
	move	17,[iowd....]
  becomes when ^E is typed on the second line:

start:	reset^Mm^Jove	17,[iowd....]


 Eric03/20/79 22:54:36VANMELLEI second the motionThe users of this news facility so far are myself, SRISW, and
Rubenstein; of these, SRISW and I hate it -- what's wrong with BBD
anyway?  If this feature is desirable, where are the users who like it?
I say flush it if there is no great clamor for it.

SRISW's point about changing the system too often is also well taken.  I
have no objection to people developing and advertising macro libraries
with new features.  But changing the default system (in particular all
the nonsense that has been creeping into <EMACS>EMACS.INIT) without definite
user support is a bad idea.  Publicize things and let people try them
optionally (e.g. let them put something in their init), but don't do it
in such a way that it is difficult or even impossible to avoid if the
user deems the feature undesirable.  Poll the community and see what
they really want!!03/19/79 21:18:26SRISWEMACS changing too oftenIt would seem that SUMEX is having a problem with EMACS that other sites
on the network have experienced. Specifically, the maintainer, in
wanting to bring the most features and usefulness to the local EMACS,
changes it too often thus rendering the entire EMACS user community
angry and confused a great deal of the time. Let me suggest a simple
solution. I maintain EMACS at SRI-KL and SRI-KA, and when I want to make
a change or add a feature, I always send a note to the bulletin board
and wait for the response.  If at least 90% of the people approve of the
change, then the new EMACS is generated and put on NEW:. If not, then
the change is simply not put in. I keep these changes to a bare minimum
and never take more than one poll a month. The results have been
graitfying and you might do well to implement your scheme in this manner,
including flushing this silly ENEWS frob. That is what bulletin boards
are for, and your BBD system certainly should carry all these notes.
Not some local software hack.03/19/79 10:59:31SCHOENI vote for consistency
Sorry for sounding like an ass, but I say EMACS should remain the same
for at least two days at a time.... 
  Eric
03/17/79 16:12:18VANMELLEFlush the news!I agree with srisw.  This news system is superfluous.  There already
exists a mechanism for communication among emacs users, viz. the
bulletin board (BBD).  Interested users can put the EMACS topic on their
interest lists and use BBD or BBREAD to read them when they appear;
they can also POST notices of interest to others.

Besides, I'd prefer not to add any more to the initial emacs startup
time, and certainly not for this news system.

	Bill03/17/79 12:59:48SRISWIll
I think this news frob is somewhat ill and slightly dumb. If
people want to send mail, they can do it with the mail system,
not some non-standard thing03/17/79 11:07:59RUBENSTEINKEYPAD library no longer loaded by defaultA few users have objected to the idea that Sumex-AIM EMACS be any
different from EMACS anywhere else, so I have decided to make
the default EMACS not load the KEYPAD library by default.  It can
still, of course, be loaded with MM Load Library$KEYPAD$ either
from your INIT file or explicitly.

I would appreciate hearing from users about this and other issues
(on either side)...  There will be a message when EMACS starts up
to the effect that the KEYPAD lib is no longer loaded (unless you
happen to have 1M.VKEYPAD Inhibit$ in your init file!) for a few days.
Also, comments on the news facility would be appreciated.  In fact,
use M-X Run Library$ENEWS$Post to post your opinions!

Stew
03/15/79 02:44:40RUBENSTEINWhen is the KEYPAD library NOT loaded?The KEYPAD library is not loaded if
 1) You are not on a datamedia, or
 2) You make Q$KEYPAD Inhibit$ non-zero in your INIT file.

Someone suggested to me that KEYPAD should NEVER be loaded by default
although those who wished to have it loaded could put it in their
INIT file.

Comments, anyone?

Stew

P.S. In case I never mentioned it, part of my job is to write INIT
files at users request.  If there's anything that you want loaded
automatically, or any command that you want redefined, let me know.
03/15/79 01:09:34RUBENSTEINEMACS News ServiceThe EMACS news file can be accessed via two commands in the
ENEWS library:

Post EMACS News
	This command will ask for a subject, then let you type
	your news into a buffer.  When you exit the recursive
	EMACS with C-M-C, your news will be posted.

Read EMACS News
	This command enables you to read recent EMACS news.  It types
	the date, author, and subject of each news item, most recent
	first, and asks you if you want to see the rest.  If you
	answer Y or <Space>, it types it at you and asks for the next.
	If you answer N or <delete>, it asks about the next without
	typing it.  If you answer X or Q, it quits asking and returns.

Try it!
