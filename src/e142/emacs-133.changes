Changes in EMACS version 133:

*) The self documentation features now know about names for the
built-in TECO ^R command definitions.  For example, Apropos of "Line"
will now show ^R Open Line on C-O.  You can't actually call those
commands by those names, unless you load the library BARE;  this
library is temporarily loaded by the documentation commands that need
it.  MM& Load BARE loads BARE and causes BARE to remain loaded until
its caller returns.

*) C-U C-Y differs from plain C-Y in that it leaves point before
the un-killed text and the mark after.

*) C-U C-L causes the line point is on to be redisplayed.
Actual numeric arguments (not just C-U) still specify
a line to display point on.

*) C-; and M-; (^R Indent for Comment) now inserts the comment
terminator as well as the comment starter, leaving point in between
them.  M-N and M-P (^R Down Comment Line, and .. Up ..), have been
modified for this behavior.

*) M-G and M-Q (^R Fill Paragraph and ^R Fill Region) now by default
remove excess spaces such as are produced by filling.

*) Return now will not gobble a blank line followed by a nonblank
line.

*) C-K will now treat a blank line as if it were empty, killing
through the CRLF instead of to it.  More specifically, if point is
followed by a CRLF with only whitespace in between, C-K will kill
through the CRLF.

*) M-[ and M-] (^R Backward Paragraph, and ... Forward ...), now treat
"\" at the front of a line just like "." and "-", for the sake of TEX
files.  This special treatment is that if those characters are
declared (using QParagraph Delimiter) to start paragraphs, then
whenever a paragraph starts for that reason, that paragraph is only
one line long.

*) You can now put MM Query Replace on a character.  It will read its
arguments in the echo area.

*) Errors in auto-saving will type out "(Auto Save Error!)".

*) ^R Indent Nested (the definition of Tab in certain modes) now does
something useful with negative arguments.  It indents the line more
than the previous line, (* (ABS ARGUMENT) (MAX 1 QIndent Increment))
spaces more.  QIndent Increment is not initially defined.

*) There is now an autoloading definition for C-X ( which loads in
KBDMAC and transfers to it.  People need no longer load KBDMAC in
their init files.  You will now see "Def" in the mode line while
defining a keyboard macro.

*) Exiting from the top-level ^R invocation now returns to EMACS's
superior.  To exit from it back to TECO command level, do
1MM Top Level.  This will advise you to re-enter ^R mode by doing
:M..L.  Returning to the superior will now clear out the mode line
completely.

*) Creating a new buffer initializes it in the same mode as the
previous selected buffer.  This uses the new @F^G command in TECO.

*) Making variables like QAuto Fill Mode local now works
straightforwardly;  it is no longer necessary to deal with the crock
Switch Modes Process Options, which no longer exists.  These variables
have been equipped with macros which are run whenever their values
change.  Thus, simply doing 1UAuto Fill Mode is enough to turn on
the mode.  MM & Process Options no longer exists.  A side effect of
this is that buffer switching is much faster.  This uses the new
FS VAR MACRO feature of TECO.  QProcess Options Hook no longer
exists; instead, you must make macros to be run when your variables'
values change.  This will be documented in CONV later.

*) Instead of calling MM & Set Mode Line, macros should simply do
1FS Mode Change, which will cause MM & Set Mode Line to be called
when the mode line comes up for redisplay.  Thus, multiple reasons for
calling it will not cause it to be called more than once.
QSet Mode Line Hook still exists and works as before.
