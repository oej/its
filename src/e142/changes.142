Changes to EMACS in version 142:

I believe this covers all of the visible changes;  if you
find any more PLEASE let me (Rubenstein) know so I can add
it to the list.  In addition to the following, the internal
documentation has been cleaned up and simplified considerably,
an attempt which is still going on.  If you come across anything
that you think is unclear, please let me know.

1.  File visiting changed somewhat;  C-X C-E command removed.
    See internal documentation for new behavior.

2.  In autosave mode, C-X C-S does a normal save (i.e. with real
    filename).  If given an argument, saves under autosave filename
    (i.e. sense of argument reversed).

3.  C-X : (^R Set Column) removed.

4.  The Count Lines command has been removed.  In its place, C-X L
    (which normally counts lines on a page) can be given an argument,
    causing it to count lines in the whole buffer.

5.  The command C-] has been changed from Macro Q-register to
    Abort Recursive Edit.  This can be used as an emergency exit
    to commands which call EMACS recursively (e.g. Alter Options).

6.  Comments which start with two comment start characters are
    aligned as if they were code.  Triple comment character
    causes alignment at left margin.  This will mostly interest
    lisp people.

7.  M-K now kills next sentence, rather than duplicating M-D.

8.  C-M-X runs Instant Extended Command.  Like M-X with no
    arguments.  See the internal doc.

9.  All "Exchange" commands have been renamed "Transpose"

10. The "Lisp ) Hack" variable is now renamed to "Display matching
    Paren" and defaults ON.

11. Variable Apropos, List One File have been deleted.

12. Count Lines, Make Variable and Set Variable Comment have
    been made into subroutines.

13. Edit ..D has been renamed to Edit Syntax Table.

14. Get Date has been renamed to Insert Date.

15. Several new commands:  Undo, Set Variable, Set Key, Delete File,
    Copy File, and Rename File.  See internal documentation for
    description.

16. The Auto Save on exit now saves in the real filename.

17. Teleray 1061 and Heath terminals are now supported as
    terminal types 17 and 18.  Anyone using a terminal
    other than a datamedia, please drop me a note...  I'd
    like to know what other terminal support is required.

18. Redisplay is much smarter about tabs, when to use I/D char, etc.

19. Most minor mode commands (Auto Fill, Auto Save, Overwrite, etc)
    now toggle the mode if given no argument.  They still turn the
    mode on with arg > 0 and off with arg <= 0.

20. Auto save mode now takes only one argument, turning it on or off.
    Number of versions and  interval are now controlled by setting
    the variables Auto Save Max and Auto Save Interval.

21. Libraries may now contain a macro called & Kill <libname> Library
    which can do any necessary cleaning up if and when that library
    is killed.
